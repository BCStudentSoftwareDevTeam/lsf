# Rework of Labor Status Forms.net into a flask application

## FIX ME: Add initial setup for future developers ##

## Updating models
Use Peewee Migrator to update models: https://pypi.org/project/peewee-migrations/


1. Install: ```pip install peewee-migrations``` (included in setup.sh, so you shouldn't need this)
2. ```pem init```
3. Add models to watch: ```pem add app.models.user.User```
4. Watch the model for changes: ```pem watch```
5. When done changing models, run the migrator to modify the db: ```pem migrate```

Additional helpful commands:
List active migrations: ```pem list```
Show SQL generated by changes to the model: ```pem show```
