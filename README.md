# Rework of Labor Status Forms .NET into a Flask application

## FIX ME: Add initial setup for future developers ##


## Updating models
Use Peewee Migrator to update models: https://pypi.org/project/peewee-migrations/

1. Install: ```pip install peewee-migrations``` (included in setup.sh, so you shouldn't need this)
2. ```pem init```
3. Add models to watch: e.g., ```pem add app.models.user.User```
4. Watch the model for changes: ```pem watch```
5. When done changing models, run the migrator to modify the db: ```pem migrate```

NOTE: You don't need to watch the files before you begin making changes.
The watch will compare the db to your model file and make any changes that are inconsistent.

Additional helpful commands:
List active migrations: ```pem list```
Show SQL generated by changes to the model: ```pem show```
